# [RTL Design And Synthesis Workshop Using Sky130](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/rtl-design-using-verilog-with-sky130-technology/)


Welcome to the **RTL Workshop**, a hands-on learning series focused on Verilog RTL design, simulation, synthesis, and digital circuit optimization. 
This repository documents my learning journey through a 10-day workshop on RTL Design and Synthesis using the Sky130 PDK. It covers practical aspects of Verilog-based RTL design, with a focus on how design choices translate to silicon implementation. It also explores the synthesis process and its impact on downstream stages in the ASIC design flow.
Whether you're a beginner or brushing up on fundamentals, there's a lot to explore here. Let’s dive into the world of silicon design—exciting things ahead!

## About This Workshop

This workshop is intended for students, hobbyists, and engineers who want to learn about:

- Verilog RTL design and simulation
- Using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave for simulation and waveform analysis
- Logic synthesis using Yosys and the SKY130 open-source PDK
- Key digital design concepts: testbenches, timing libraries, D flip-flop coding styles, and optimization techniques

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of digital logic (gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, etc.)
- Familiarity with Linux shell commands
- A Linux environment (or WSL on Windows/macOS)
- Tools: `git`, `iverilog`, `gtkwave`, `yosys`, and a text editor
