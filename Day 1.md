# Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis

Welcome to Day 1 of the RTL Design Workshop!

Today marks the beginning of your hands-on exploration into the world of digital logic design. You'll start by getting familiar with **Verilog**, dive into **open-source simulation** using **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)**, and take your first steps into **logic synthesis** using **Yosys**.

This session combines essential theory with practical labs to help you understand how real-world RTL design is done. By the end of the day, you‚Äôll have built and simulated your first Verilog design, and synthesized it using a powerful open-source toolchain.

Let‚Äôs get started and lay a solid foundation for your RTL design skills!

## 1. Understanding Simulator, Design, and Testbench
### Simulator
A simulator is a software-based tool used to evaluate the behavior of a digital circuit. It allows you to apply input signals and observe the resulting outputs, helping to verify the logic before it‚Äôs implemented on hardware.

### Design
The design refers to the Verilog source code that describes the logic and functionality of the digital system you are building.

### Testbench
A testbench is a simulation wrapper that drives input signals to the design and monitors the outputs. It acts as a virtual testing environment to validate the behavior of your design under various conditions.

## 2. Getting Started with Icarus Verilog (iverilog)
- iverilog is an open-source Verilog simulation tool. Below is a typical workflow:

- Write your design and testbench in Verilog.

- Use iverilog to compile both files into a simulation executable.

- Run the executable to simulate your design. During this process, a .vcd (Value Change Dump) file is generated.

- Open the .vcd file in GTKWave, a waveform viewer, to analyze signal transitions and verify the logic visually.

## 3. Loading design to iverilog:
Eg : good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v

### Step 1:
> iverilog design name.v testbench-associated.v
eg: > iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
- A file will be generated:
a.out (file generated)

### Step 2 : Execute a.out
> ./a.out
- A Vcd file will be generated.
> For this example:
tb_good_mux.vcd will be generated
### Step 3: Load it to simulator
> gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
- View the waveform to check then input and output of the design.

## 4. Yosys - Open Source Verilog Synthesis

### üõ†Ô∏è What is Yosys?

Yosys is an open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. It reads your Verilog design and maps it to a target technology, such as standard-cell libraries or FPGAs. It is widely used in academia, research, and open-source silicon projects.

## 5. Synthesis Lab with Yosys

Let‚Äôs synthesize the `good_mux` design using Yosys!

###  Step-by-Step Yosys Flow

1. **Start Yosys**
    ```shell
    yosys
    ```

2. **Read the liberty library**
    ```shell
    read_liberty -lib /address/to/your/sky130/file/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
    ```

3. **Read the Verilog code**
    ```shell
    read_verilog /home/vsduser/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files/good_mux.v
    ```

4. **Synthesize the design**
    ```shell
    synth -top good_mux
    ```

5. **Technology mapping**
    ```shell
    abc -liberty /address/to/your/sky130/file/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
    ```

6. **Visualize the gate-level netlist**
    ```shell
    show
    ```

# Logic Synthesis 
## RTL design
- Behavioral representation of the required specification.
## Synthesis 
- RTL to Gate level translation.
- The design is converted into gates and the connections are made between the gates.
- This is given out as the file called **Netlist**.

---

# What is .lib 
- Collection of logical modules.
- includes basic gates like and, or, not etc,.
- There will be different flavours of same gate.
